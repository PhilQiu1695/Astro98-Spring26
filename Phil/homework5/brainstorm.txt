Topic: Quantum Computing
Source: The IBM Quantum "Qiskit" documentation for physics simulations.
Summary: This relates to the topic by giving tools to simulate quantum systems that are too complex for classical computers. 

Topic: Dark Matter
Source: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) public data release.
Summary: The source provides vast maps of galaxy distributions that scientists use to perform weak gravitational lensing analysis.
This can help reveal the location of dark matter by showing how it bends the light of distant galaxies.

Topic: Black Holes
Source: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Image Data (M87* or Sgr A*).
Summary: This data provides the first-ever direct visual evidence of a black hole's shadow. 
It allows researchers to test general relativity in extreme environments and measure the mass and spin of supermassive black holes.

Idea.simpler
Write a Python script that demonstrates Shor's Algorithm to find the prime factors of a number. 
I could write a function that takes a small integer and simulate how a quantum computer would find its factors using modular exponentiation and period finding. 
The script would use a simple loop to compare the speed of this "quantum" approach against a standard classical "trial division" loop.

Idea.complicated
A Quantum Coin-Flip & Random Walk Simulator. 
Instead of a full stellar fusion model, I would use Python to simulate a "Quantum Random Walk". 
While a classical random walk stays near the center, a quantum walk spreads out much faster. 
I could use a Python library to simulate quantum "superposition" to show how a quantum particle moves across a grid compared to a classical one.
